<h1>AdBlock Locus</h1>
<p>
	K-Meleon is a privacy-focused web browser that comes with a built-in adblocker. However, it does not come with a graphical interface for that adblocker. AdBlock Locus provides a graphical interface to toggle the adblocker, create custom rules, manage subscriptions, and create exceptions.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>
	<b>Q: How do I allow sites with AdBlock Locus?</b><br>
	A: You can allow all sites, by temporarily toggling the adblocker off. You can allow ads on the current site by right-clicking the AdBlock Locus icon and choosing "Allow Domain" in the menu. This will create a custom exception rule in adblock_user.txt in your profile. You will then need to <b>Refresh Rules</b> to load your custom rules. The adblock plugin may have issues with these exception rules on some setups. Any exceptions you create will take effect the next time you start K-Meleon.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Q: Will AdBlock Locus add support for features like element hiding?</b><br>
	A: AdBlock Locus only operates the built-in adblocker. If the BAB doesn't support a feature like element hiding or the $document exception, the feature will not be available.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Q: Can I use K-Meleon's built-in ad blocker without an extension?</b><br>
	A: Yes. If you set up the BAB with AdBlock Locus and then uninstall the extension, you will still have the built-in blocking abilities. You can manually toggle the adblocker from the "Kplugins" preferences panel. You will still have the AdBlock Locus subscriptions set up and can manually refresh them by deleting "adblock.txt" in your profile and restarting K-Meleon.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Q:Can I just use K-Meleon's Privacy Bar to toggle ad-blocking?</b><br>
	A:Yes, after you install AdBlock Locus. If you're using <b>K-Meleon's Default theme</b> or another new-style theme:
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Select "Edit - Configuration - Toolbars"</b> in the menu to open your configuration file. <b>Save an exact copy</b> of this file to your profile folder or your skin's folder. Don't save modification's here.
			</li>
			<li>
				Press <b>Ctrl+F</b> in the text editor that pops up and type <b>Privacy Bar</b> to scroll down.
			</li>			
			<li>
				<b>Copy and paste</b> the code below, <b>save toolbars.cfg</b>,  and <b>restart</b> K-Meleon:
			</li>
			</ol>

</p>
<p>
	<b>Q: How do I uninstall the extension?</b><br>
	A: You can completely uninstall AdBlock Locus by deleting the Adblockplugin.kmm file. You can disable it (or any other macro module) by in the browser by going to <b>Edit - Configuration (F2) -- K-Meleon Plugins - Macro Extension</b> and clicking the checkbox beside AdBlock Locus. You can disable AdBlock Locus (or any other macro module) from file manager by renaming the file to Adblockplugin.<b>txt</b>.
