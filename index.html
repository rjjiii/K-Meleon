<h1>K-Meleon Tools</h1>
</br></br>
<h2>Extensions</h2>

<h3>
	<img src="AdBlockClassic.png"> 
	<a href="AdBlockClassic/">
	AdBlock Classic</a>
</h3>
<p>
	AdBlock Classic is an open-source ad-blocker for K-Meleon. It's an updated and de-branded descendant of the classic AdBlock Plus extension for Firefox. Ad Block Classic can use ABP filters and rules (including AdBlock Locus's Fallback subscription). 
</p>


</br>
<h3>
	<img src="K-PDF.png"> 
	<a href="K-PDF/">
	K-PDF</a>
</h3>
<p>
	This extension will open PDF documents in the browser. It uses K-Meleon's javascript engine, not NPAPI so you get the security benefit of all of the browser's security patches and bugfixes.
</p>


</br>
<h3>
	<img src="PasswordExtractor.png" height="16"> 
	<a href="https://rjjiii.github.io/Password-Extractor/">
	Password Extractor</a>
</h3>
<p>
	Transfer passwords between browsers. This extension for K-Meleon can also be installed on other browsers that use XUL including SeaMonkey, Pale Moon, Mypal, and Waterfox Classic. Its XML export/import format is used by Password Exporter (for Firefox and SeaMonkey) and Password Backup Tool (for Pale Moon and Basilisk). It can also handle a simpler CSV export for popular browsers and password managers including Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi, KeePass, and KeePassXC.
</p>

</br>
<h3>
	<img src="AdBlockLocus.png"> 
	<a href="AdBlockLocus/">
	AdBlock Locus</a>
</h3>
<p>
	K-Meleon is a privacy-focused web browser that comes with a built-in adblocker (BAB). However, it does not come with a graphical interface for that adblocker. AdBlock Locus (ABL) provides a graphical interface to toggle the BAB, create custom rules, manage subscriptions, and create exceptions. AdBlock Locus is lightweight and by default uses a custom lightweight blocklist; it can also use popular blocklist subscriptions like Easylist.
</p>

</br>
<h3>
	&#128228;
	<a href="ExtensionHauler/">
	Extension Hauler</a>
</h3>
<p>
	Use Extension Hauler to export XUL-based extensions from K-Meleon. It makes upgrading versions a snap.
</p>

</br>
<h3>
	&#128706; 
	<a href="AboutTime/">
	About Time</a>
</h3>
<p>
	About Time adds an About button to extensions in K-Meleon's Add-ons list. You can pop up the about dialog for any extension from the "about:addons" page instead of combing through files.
</p>



</br></br>
<h2>Skins (Themes)</h2>
<h3>
	<img src="HighResolution.png"> 
	<a href="HighResolution/">
	High Resolution (reference theme)</a>
</h3>
<p>
	High Resolution uses the same excellent icons from Lim Chee Aun's Phoenity Aura project that K-Meleon uses by default. High Resolution expands the browser's default skin to display better on higher resolution monitors and systems with scaling enabled. This skin was designed to help users and desginers who wish to create skins for K-Meleon and includes many comments. 
</p>

</br>
<h3>
	<img src="Phoenity.png"> 
	<a href="Phoenity/">
	Phoenity (template)</a>
</h3>
<p>
	Phoenity was once the default theme for K-Meleon. All versions of K-Meleon are backwards compatible with the classic style of themes. You can still use Phoenity as a theme for K-Meleon or as a template to develop new themes.
</p>

</br>
<h3>
	<img src="Archetypal.png"> 
	<a href="Archetypal/">
	Archetypal</a>
</h3>
<p>
	Archetypal is a skin inspired by the classic Netscape Navigator 4 design. The name is based on the idea that Netscape was a fundamental part of our collective imagination of what the web was and what it could be.
</p>

</br>
<h3>
	<img src="Feather.png"> 
	<a href="Feather/">
	Feather</a>
</h3>
<p>
	Feather is a set of clean, elegant, modern icons available under the MIT license. This skin uses the Feather icons to build a complete 75-style theme (works with current releases of K-Meleon too, but not 74 for Windows 2000) with replacements for all icons at 16-48 pixel resolutions.
</p>

</br>
<h3>
	<img src="HighResolution.png"> 
	<a href="AuraAlpha_Legacy/">
	AuraAlpha (Legacy)</a>
</h3>
<p>
	AuraAlpha (Legacy) is for K-Meleon on Windows 2000. It is a modified version of K-Meleon 74's default theme that removes alpha transparencies which were not supported in Windows 2000. It will also solve the black rectangle glitches on ReactOS.
</p>



</br></br>
<h2>Reference Extensions</h2>
<h3>
	<img src="HelloWorld.png"> 
	<a href="HelloWorld/">
	"Hello World" reference extensions.</a>
</h3>
<p>
	Learn from these simple demo extensions. They all create "Hello world!" alerts but use several different programming techniques to demonstrate K-Meleon APIs like JSbridge and the macro language.
