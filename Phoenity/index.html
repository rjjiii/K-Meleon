<h1>Phoenity</h1>
<p>
	Phoenity was once the default theme for K-Meleon. It was created by artist Lim Chee Aun in collaboration with the K-Meleon development team. It was designed originally for lower resolution monitors and should still work fine on older systems. Its layout is very clean and because it was tested as the default theme, it makes a perfect template if you're creating a classic-style theme for K-Meleon. Current versions of K-Meleon are backwards compatible with this old style. For new style of themes, download <a href="../HighResolution/">High Resolution</a> to use as a reference and template.
